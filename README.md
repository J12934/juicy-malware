# JuicyMalware

This repo contains some fake "malware" to use against [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop) in its SSTI and SSRF Challenges.

---

This "malware" is actually **completely harmless**. It does **not** do anything malicious! But don't just take our word :wink: for it:

:microscope: Put on your lab coat and **reverse engineer the "malware"** to find out what it actually does!

:information_source: To clarify, you will _need to perform this task_ to be able to solve the SSTI and SSRF challenges.

---

:warning: _Please make sure the source code for this "malware" remains secret so the challenges are not spoilered for future hacker generations! Thank you!_
